    Below are different overflow properties.
    Only the LAST one written will take effect — here it's `overflow: auto;`.

    overflow: visible;  
    → Default behavior.
    → Content that overflows the box is still shown outside.
    → No scrollbars.

    overflow: hidden;
    → Extra content is cut off.
    → No scrollbars are shown — content is simply not visible.

    overflow: scroll;
    → Always shows scrollbars (horizontal/vertical), even if not needed.
    → User can scroll to see hidden content.

    overflow: auto;
    → Best and most flexible.
    → Scrollbars appear **only when needed**.
    → Preferred choice in most real-world layouts.

    overflow: auto;  /* ✅ This one takes effect — scrollbars only appear if content overflows */
